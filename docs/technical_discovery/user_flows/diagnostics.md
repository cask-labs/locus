# Diagnostics & Logs

**Goal:** Provide transparent, real-time insight into system health and deep debugging capabilities without requiring external tools (ADB).

*   **Step 1: Access:**
    *   The user taps the "Logs" tab in the Bottom Navigation.
    *   **Initial View:** The screen displays a live-updating stream of log entries, starting from the most recent (Reverse Layout).

*   **Step 2: Filtering:**
    *   The user taps **Filter Chips** pinned to the top of the screen (e.g., `Error`, `Warn`, `Net`, `Auth`).
    *   **Behavior:** Filters are **multi-select**. Tapping a chip toggles the visibility of that log level/category.
    *   **Visuals:** Log lines are color-coded to match their severity (e.g., Error = Red, Network = Blue).

*   **Step 3: Real-Time Monitoring:**
    *   As new logs are generated by background services (Tracking, Sync), they appear instantly at the bottom of the list.
    *   **Auto-Scroll:** If the user is at the bottom of the list, it automatically scrolls to show new entries. If the user has scrolled up to inspect history, the position is maintained.

*   **Step 4: Export (Data Sovereignty):**
    *   **User Intent:** The user wants to save logs for analysis or share them with a developer.
    *   **Action:** User taps the **"Share"** button in the top-right corner.
    *   **Process:**
        1.  The app flushes the entire internal circular buffer to a temporary `.txt` file.
        2.  The app triggers the **Android System Share Sheet**.
    *   **Outcome:** The user selects a target app (e.g., Gmail, Drive, Quick Share) to send the file.
