# System Recovery (Re-provisioning)

**Goal:** Restore access to existing data on a new device.

*   **Scenario:** A user installs the app on a new phone but wants to keep using their existing S3 bucket.
*   **Step 1: Credential Entry:**
    *   The user enters their AWS keys.
*   **Step 2: Bucket Discovery:**
    *   The app checks for existing Locus stacks/buckets associated with these keys.
    *   The user selects the existing bucket.
*   **Outcome:** The app links to the existing bucket without attempting to create a new CloudFormation stack. History becomes immediately available.
