# AWS CloudFormation Rules

*   **Template Format:** Use YAML for all CloudFormation templates to ensure readability and comments support.
*   **Parameters:** Type all parameters strictly and provide descriptions to validate input during stack creation.
*   **Tagging:** Apply consistent tags to all resources to support cost allocation and resource management.
*   **Outputs:** Export useful values from stacks to allow cross-stack references and easier access to resource identifiers.
*   **Modularity:** Break down complex infrastructures into nested stacks or separate templates to maintain manageability.
