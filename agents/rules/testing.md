# Testing Rules

*   **Unit Tests:** Write unit tests for all business logic and view models to ensure individual components work as expected.
*   **Instrumentation Tests:** Implement instrumentation tests for Android UI components and integration points.
*   **Infrastructure Validation:** Validate CloudFormation templates using linting tools before deployment.
*   **Test Coverage:** Aim for high test coverage on critical paths and complex logic.
*   **Continuous Integration:** Automate the execution of tests on every pull request to catch regressions early.
