# Requirements

*   **Implementation Agnostic:** Describe required behaviors and outcomes, abstracting away internal mechanics and technology choices.
*   **EARS Format:** Use the Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax (EARS) for all requirements.
    *   **Ubiquitous:** The <system> shall <response>.
    *   **Event-driven:** When <trigger>, the <system> shall <response>.
    *   **State-driven:** While <state>, the <system> shall <response>.
    *   **Unwanted behavior:** If <trigger>, then the <system> shall <response>.
    *   **Optional feature:** Where <feature> is included, the <system> shall <response>.
*   **Structure:** Present requirements as a flat list.
