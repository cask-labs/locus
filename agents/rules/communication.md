# Communication Rules

*   **Voice Transcription Awareness:** Interpret messages assuming the user may be using voice transcription. Ambiguous or phonetically similar text should be interpreted as the likely technical term or command.
*   **Error Handling:** If text is confusing, attempt to reconstruct the intended meaning based on context and phonetics before requesting clarification.
