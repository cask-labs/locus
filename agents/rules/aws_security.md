# AWS Security Rules

*   **Least Privilege:** Grant only the permissions necessary for a resource or user to perform its intended task.
*   **S3 Privacy:** Configure S3 buckets to be private by default and block public access unless explicitly required.
*   **Encryption:** Enable server-side encryption for all data at rest and force SSL/TLS for data in transit.
*   **IAM Roles:** Prefer IAM roles over long-term access keys for services and applications running on AWS.
*   **Security Groups:** Restrict network access using security groups by allowing only required ports and protocols from known sources.
