# Kotlin Rules

*   **Immutability:** Prefer immutable variables and data structures to ensure thread safety and predictability.
*   **Concurrency:** Use Kotlin Coroutines for asynchronous operations.
*   **Null Safety:** Leverage Kotlin's type system to handle nullability safely; avoid the non-null assertion operator.
*   **Naming:** Follow standard Kotlin naming conventions for classes, functions, and properties.
*   **Data Classes:** Use data classes for simple data holders to automatically generate utility functions.
