# Android Architecture Rules

*   **Architecture Pattern:** Implement the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) or MVI (Model-View-Intent) pattern to separate concerns.
*   **Dependency Injection:** Use dependency injection to manage dependencies and improve testability.
*   **Reactive Programming:** Utilize reactive streams for observing data changes in the UI.
*   **Lifecycle Awareness:** Ensure components are lifecycle-aware to prevent memory leaks and crashes.
*   **Persistence:** Use the Room persistence library for local data storage and abstraction.
