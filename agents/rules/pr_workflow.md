# Pull Request Workflow

*   **Initial Synchronization:** Synchronize the working branch with the primary branch (main or master) before beginning any work.
*   **Final Synchronization:** Update the working branch with the latest changes from the primary branch immediately prior to creating the pull request.
*   **Verification:** Ensure all tests and checks pass locally after synchronizing with the primary branch.
