# Approach: Joint Architecture Exploration

## Intent

Work through architectural concepts conversationally using concise documentation, ensuring alignment on strategy and shared buy-in before code development begins.

**Core Values:**

- **Partnership, not directives** - Show possibilities, seek input, respond to guidance
- **Minimal yet meaningful docs** - Sufficient detail to explore and decide, nothing more
- **Cyclical and adaptive** - Designed to shift direction as needed based on input
- **Inquiry-driven** - Expose open questions, competing interests, and design choices; treat implementation specifics as premature

## Scope and Context

Suitable for teams of any size and composition—whether creating backend infrastructure, native mobile applications, or integrated platform features. Adjust language and references to align with your tech choices and design principles.

## Success Criteria (What Success Looks Like)

- 2-3 distinct architectural approaches with explicit tradeoffs explained
- A chosen architecture with clear justification for the choice
- Materials & Inventory (tangible outputs needed without step-by-step instructions)
- Repository footprint (modules, files, and changes required)
- Requirements tracking (link spec items to implementation pieces)
- Team alignment and readiness to move forward

## Starting Materials

- Specification sketch or feature request (rough is okay)
- Architectural foundations (design patterns, technology choices, organizational norms already in place)

## Artifact Organization and Retention

Store all discovery outputs under `./agents/ephemeral/{feature}-discovery/` (create folder as needed).
Transition to `docs/` only after team sign-off.

**Required Files (one per purpose):**

```
./agents/ephemeral/{feature}-discovery/
  01-architecture-options.md      # Step 1: Viable paths with core tradeoffs
  02-selection.md                 # Step 2: Side-by-side comparison + decision + why
  03-bill-of-materials.md         # Step 3: What components are needed (boundaries, patterns, setup)
  04-repository-delta.md          # Step 4: Concrete file changes (locations, types, sizes)
  05-spec-alignment.md            # Step 4: How spec requirements map to design pieces
  (optional) 06-adr.md            # Step 5: Architectural Decision Record (when stakes are high)
```

## Workflow Steps

### Step 0 — Initial Conversation and Framing

**Listen first, propose second.**

Recap the specification to the user and pose:

- "I've reviewed the spec. What are your early instincts on how to structure this?"
- "What limits or must-haves should guide my thinking?"
- "Are certain design approaches worth exploring, or should I avoid specific patterns?"

**Then** articulate the problem space:

- Reframe goal and boundaries in 5-10 lines
- Call out constraints (latency targets, data privacy rules, external systems, service dependencies)
- Name things we don't yet know

**Work product:** Goal + Scope + Open Items (either spoken or sketched lightly)

**Checkpoint:** [ ] User has offered direction or given clearance to proceed

---

### Step 1 — Outline 2-3 Architectural Paths

**Objective:** Surface distinct solutions with their respective strengths and weaknesses.

For each path:

- Overview (2-3 sentences covering the approach)
- Flow and connections (how data comes in, what happens, what goes out)
- Core decisions (uniqueness handling, error recovery, separation of concerns)
- Advantages and disadvantages
- Possible obstacles and unknowns
- **Scale of effort** (e.g., "6 new files, 2 existing files touched, ~350 lines of code")

**Strategy:**

1. **Path A (Foundation):** Conventional approach following proven patterns in your codebase
2. **Path B (Enhanced):** Overcomes drawbacks in Path A through additional structure
3. **Path C (Different):** Takes a materially different stance (optional; skip if A/B cover the space)

**Work product:** `01-architecture-options.md` displaying all paths in parallel

**Checkpoint:** [ ] 2-3 paths presented clearly; [ ] Benefits and costs obvious; [ ] Effort estimates included

---

### Step 2 — Collaborative Path Selection

**Check in before committing.**

Show a side-by-side view considering:

- Alignment with existing codebase patterns
- How much machinery is required
- Level of exposure to failure modes
- Ease of running and supporting
- Room to grow and modify
- Realistic timeline to completion

**Pose to the user:**

- "Which path feels right to your instincts?"
- "Do any tradeoffs merit deeper exploration?"
- "Should I sharpen or expand any path before we lock it in?"

**Then** write down what was chosen and the reasoning.

**Work product:** `02-selection.md` with side-by-side table + chosen path + explanation

**Checkpoint:** [ ] User endorses selection or recommends iteration

---

### Step 3 — Materials and Inventory

**Objective:** Detail what tangible and intangible things the solution requires.

**In this section:**

- **Connection points:**
  - Inbound: form of input, what prompts action, shape of data
  - Outbound: where results go, mechanism of transfer, interface contracts
- **Feature modules:** Packages and namespaces that will be created or extended
- **Horizontal concerns:**
  - Idempotency: how duplicate work is prevented (e.g., "lookup by unique key before proceeding")
  - Durability: how failures are managed (e.g., "retry transient issues, stop on bad input")
  - Data safety/Privacy: how sensitive data is treated (e.g., "never include user data in traces, mandate authorized callers")
  - Monitoring: key data to track (names and varieties only, e.g., "items_processed counter")
  - *For mobile:*
    - Offline mode: how data stays in sync, clash handling
    - Resource use: impact on battery life, data transfer, app footprint
    - Platform standards: OS design conventions, accessibility
    - App states: reactions to suspension, backgrounding, startup
- **Setup/Toggles:** Parameters that can be tuned (names only, no hardcoded values)
- **External libraries/Services:** Third-party packages needed (e.g., "database driver", "REST client", "analytics SDK")
- **Unanswered questions and gaps**

**Out of scope:**

- Low-level retry timing (framework-specific tuning)
- Alert thresholds and escalation rules
- Test coverage strategy
- Deployment and maintenance guides
- Specification linkage (covered separately in Step 4)

**Work product:** `03-bill-of-materials.md`

**Checkpoint:** [ ] Connection points mapped; [ ] Cross-cutting concerns named; [ ] Toolchain/libraries listed; [ ] Unknowns surfaced

---

### Step 4 — Repository Footprint and Alignment

**Objective:** Pin down exact file locations and how spec needs connect to implementation.

**Part A: Repository Footprint** (`04-repository-delta.md`)

**Show:**

- **File roster:**
  - Location (module path, filename)
  - Category (based on your patterns—e.g., interface, logic layer, connector, handler, business rules, screen model, data access, config)
  - Intent (one line per file)
  - Recycled or brand new
  - Size estimate (lines)
- **Directory sketch:** Tree view of modules and files (max ~20 lines)
- **Sample configuration:** Config block + class/property names
- **Total scope** (all code, all tests)

**Exclude:**

- Test files from the roster (account for them in totals though)
- Infrastructure config details
- Generated or boilerplate

**Part B: Spec Mapping** (`05-spec-alignment.md`)

**Show:**

- **Requirement roster:**
  - Spec requirement label (e.g., F1-F3, F4-F6)
  - What the requirement says
  - Which module(s) handle it (path or name)
  - Remarks (e.g., "Extends existing gateway", "Custom implementation")
- **Completeness report:** How many spec requirements are handled

**Work products:** `04-repository-delta.md` + `05-spec-alignment.md`

**Checkpoint:** [ ] File paths accurate; [ ] New vs. existing clear; [ ] Tree organized logically; [ ] All spec items accounted for

---

### Step 5 — Architecture Narrative (Optional)

**Objective:** Record the thinking for future reflection.

Lightweight doc that covers:

- The situation and the tension
- Possibilities examined
- What was picked and why
- Upsides, downsides, and neutral impacts
- Risks we accept

**Work product:** Decision narrative document

**Checkpoint:** [ ] Narrative captures the essential decision points

## Design Guardrails

These are suggestions—customize to fit your patterns and situation.

**Server-side systems:**
- Keep business logic decoupled; translate between external and internal schemas at seams (adapters/gateways)
- Reject bad input promptly
- Plan retry behavior explicitly; skip retries for validation errors
- Strip personal information from logs; use standardized logging
- Assign metric names deliberately and uniformly

**Native mobile:**
- Isolate business rules from UI machinery and device APIs
- Wire in test doubles (dependency injection)
- Manage system events explicitly (backgrounding, foreground, suspension)
- Persist and reuse data intelligently for offline mode
- Measure actual impact (battery, memory, data)

---

## Working Style

### At Each Pause Point:

1. **Share** what's been created or learned
2. **Listen** to concerns, choices, preferences
3. **Pause** for response
4. **Adapt** based on input and refinement requests
5. **Move forward** once there's consensus

### Conversation Example:

**You:** "I've studied the spec and can see three distinct directions forward. Before I flesh them out, what's your gut reaction on which way makes sense?"

**Them:** {share thoughts or say "show me the options"}

**You:** {present the three paths}

**You:** "Which path appeals to you? Are there tradeoffs you want to dig deeper into?"

**Them:** {give feedback}

**You:** {adjust, deepen, or move ahead based on their reply}
